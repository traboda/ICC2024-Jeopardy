### Description:

Our undercover spy has successfully retrieved a mysterious PCB from a secret laboratory. We need your help to make the LED on the PCB glow. There are multiple switches, but only the ones labeled A, B, C, D, and E are relevant to this mission. Can you figure out a way to make the led glow?

In addition, the spy also recovered a damaged CD, but most of its contents were corrupted. Fortunately, our recovery team managed to salvage some key data that looks like design blueprints or schematics. Weâ€™ve attached the recovered data below, this might hold the clues you need to complete the puzzle.

### Instructions:

    1. Reset Procedure: After powering the PCB on, you must reset it to the starting position:

        - Press and release the E button once.
        - Then, press and release the D button.
    2. Verification:

        - This challenge is manually verified. Once you successfully make the LED glow after resetting the PCB to its starting position, approach the onsite Traboda support team for verification.
